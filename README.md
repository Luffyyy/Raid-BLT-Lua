# Raid BLT
An open source Lua hook for Raid that is a fork of the payday 2 BLT hook, designed and created for ease of use for both players and modders.  
This repository is for the Lua base that controls and loads mods into Raid, and the options and save files associated with the BLT. The DLL hook code can be found in it's own [repository](https://github.com/ModWorkshop/Raid-BLT).
